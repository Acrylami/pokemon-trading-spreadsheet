# Pokémon Trading Spreadsheet

A script made to display Pokémon trading information stored in Google Sheets

## Features

* Filter Pokémon by generation, gender ratio & Poké Ball
* Display breedables, valuable Pokémon (e.g., shinies or RNGs) and wants
* Faster loading than sharing a Google Sheets document

## How to Use

1. Create a copy of this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b5QCn3UfQk7wbxzmcX3Yv8on6GREs12_q83TajSF2mQ/edit?usp=sharing) (`File > Make a Copy…`). You may rename and rearrange tabs, but be careful not to edit the columns!
2. Start filling it with your breedables, shinies, battle-ready Pokémon, or wants.
3. Make your spreadsheet public (`File > Publish to the web…`).
4. Clone this repository and edit `config.js` with your spreadsheet's ID and personal information (IGN, FC, etc.).
